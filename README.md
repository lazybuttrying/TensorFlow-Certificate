### Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning
### Convolutional Neural Networks in TensorFlow
- how to work with real-world images in different shapes and sizes, visualize the journey of an image through convolutions to understand how a computer “sees” information, 
- plot loss and accuracy, and explore strategies to prevent overfitting, including augmentation and dropout
- transfer learning and how learned features can be extracted from models. 
### Natural Language Processing in TensorFlow
- You will learn to process text, including tokenizing and representing sentences as vectors,
- learn to apply RNNs, GRUs, and LSTMs in TensorFlow
- you’ll get to train an  LSTM on existing text to create original poetry
### Sequences, Time Series and Prediction
- how to build time series models in TensorFlow
- how to prepare time series data.
- how RNNs and 1D ConvNets can be used for prediction
-  apply everything you’ve learned throughout the Specialization to build a sunspot prediction model using real-world data
